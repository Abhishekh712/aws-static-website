# AWS Static Website Hosting 
This is my first cloud project, where I hosted a static website using **Amazon S3**.
## What I Did
- Created an S3 bucket with public access
- Enabled static website hosting
- Uploaded a basic HTML page (`index.html`)
- Configured permissions to make the site publicly accessible
- Accessed my live website via the S3 bucket's endpoint
